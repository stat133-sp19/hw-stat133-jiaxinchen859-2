The Primary Gold of this HW (GSW Shot Charts)

1. Data Preparation: From the logistical point of view, We will create a csv data file shots-data.csv that will contain the required variables to be used in the visualization phase.

2. Shot Charts of each player: From the analytics point of view, We will use the shots_data.csv produced by the first step to visualize the shot data of NBA players. Specifically, we will be producing so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations. 

3) Report: From the report standpoint, we will produce a report document to analyze the performance of a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors.
